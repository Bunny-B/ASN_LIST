# Hosting Companies ASN LIST
This ASN list is really useful because it gives companies (ex: hosts) the possibility of blocking their IP ranges which could be used to ddos ​​your servers.
If you want to help me with this list send me a list of asn / ip ranges or just ips that was / is ddosing you & i'll add it to list when i'll have time!
