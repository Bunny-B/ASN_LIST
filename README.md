# üö´ Blocking Hosts by ASN and IP Ranges
This repository contains a list of Autonomous System Numbers (ASN) and IP address ranges that can be used to block malicious hosts to prevent DDoS attacks on your service. The list is updated regularly and can be used with Cloudflare's Web Application Firewall (WAF) to block traffic from these sources.

# üöÄ Getting Started
To use this list with Cloudflare's WAF, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Edit the ```ASN.txt``` & ```IP-RANGES.txt``` file to include the ASNs and IP ranges that you want to block.
Log in to your Cloudflare account and navigate to your firewall settings.
Click on "Firewall Rules" and then "Create Firewall Rule".
Choose the appropriate trigger(s) for your rule (e.g., "IP Addresses", "ASN").
Paste the contents of ```ASN.txt``` & ```IP-RANGES.txt``` into the appropriate field(s).
Save and deploy your firewall rules.
